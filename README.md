# What is BingPot?
![BingPot logo](movie/static/movie/img/logo1.png)
BingPot is a movie landing page that I came up with. I am not sure why but I thought it would be funny so I just decided to lean into it while I was thinking up the name for my site. This webpage is created using python in the backend and html, CSS and Javascript in the front end. it is also responsive with other devices including phones and tablets.

# what makes BingPot different?
## Distinctiveness and Complexity
What makes Bingpot a one in a million webpage is the balanced use of all the libraries I brought on  board mainly: 
* Jquery 3.4.1
* Bootstrap
* owl Carousel
##### This are just a few of the many dynamic online css and javascript libraries I decided to use. but that is not all that makes BingPot complex. it has a good finish with a good combination of colors but not so much that it becomes overbearing. the colours combine "just right". Also with the help of the following libraries I ensured that the smooth icons and the well shaped fonts joined together and left the website looking like a masterpiece.
* Bootstrap
* Boxicons

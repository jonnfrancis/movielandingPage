# What is BingPot?
![BingPot logo](movie/static/movie/img/logo1.png)
BingPot is a movie landing page that I came up with. I am not sure why but I thought it would be funny so I just decided to lean into it while I was thinking up the name for my site. This webpage is created using python in the backend and html, CSS and Javascript in the front end. it is also responsive with other devices including phones and tablets.
